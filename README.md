# Lucid Scripts for RPG Maker MV

These are a set of scripts for the famous [RPG Maker MV](http://www.rpgmakerweb.com/).

These are all written in ES6 and requires understanding of build tools such as [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) and [babel](https://babeljs.io/).

These scripts can be installed in to your RPG Maker game to add additional or enhance existing functionality in the game.

## Contributing

To get started, clone this repository. Either make sure you have [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) installed or [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).

Run `yarn` or `npm install` at the root of the cloned directory.

To compile the scripts run `yarn/npm run build:all:dev` for development or `yarn/npm run build:all` for production.

> ATTN!
>
> `yarn/npm run build:all` should be run before making commits and PR's
> `yarn/npm run build:all:dev` is only for your development purposes and testing the script.

Note that the `.md` files that contain the header comments, must be the same name as the the `.dist/` file thats generated by webpack.

## Submitting Bugs
